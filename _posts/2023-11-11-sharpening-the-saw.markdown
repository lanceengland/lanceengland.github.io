# Sharpening the Saw

I am a big proponent of [sharpening the saw](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-7/) and continuous learning. I think it becomes even more important in the technology industry and current job climate. At the risk of sounding slightly self-promoting, I thought I would share what I've been focusing on the past year, and what I plan to work on next.

## Certificate Marathon

Some time ago my interest was piqued by the [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) methodology, where development and operations become more integrated to increase the delivery of value to the business. My work experience through [Improving](https://www.improving.com/) has given me an opportunity to serve in different roles on multiple projects, from architecting and developing, to guiding them to deployment and being involved as tier-2 operations support. I have seen first-hand the challenges to both initial deployments, but also subsequent deployments for bug fixes and enhancements. DevOps sounded like a creative solution for addressing these challenges.

I signed up for a DevOps bootcamp and started working through the material with the goal of passing the AZ-400 exam and obtaining the [Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/devops-engineer/) certification. It didn't take long for me to realize I jumped straight into the deep end and I needed to take a few steps back and focus on some foundational knowledge first. I also discovered the DevOps Engineer Expert certification requires two exams, and I had skipped right over the pre-requisites, which covered a lot of the gaps in my knowledge.

The AZ-400 exam has a choice of two prerequisites exams: either AZ-104 which is more administrator focused, or AZ-204 which is more developer focused. I decided I had more gaps on the administration path, and decided to pursue the AZ-104.

I put the AZ-400 on pause, and poured into the AZ-104 material, using both the Microsoft Learning Paths and [James Lee’s AZ-104](https://learn.cloudlee.io/p/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator) course for my preparation. However, as I neared completion of the course, another diversion arose: Microsoft was running a Cloud Skills challenge during their Build conference, and completiion of the Azure Solutions Architect learning path earned a free voucher to sit the AZ-305 exam. The AZ-305 exam is part of two exams for the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) certification, and has the same choice of pre-requisites as the DevOps Engineer Expert certification. This would give me double the "bang for my buck" for passing the AZ-104 and apply it towards two different expert certifications.

So, you guessed it: I paused my preparation for AZ-104 to focus on AZ-305. Both the skills challenge and the free exam voucher itself were limited time offers, so it kept me hyper-focused on getting through the material and scheduling the exam. Man, the things I’ll do for a free voucher!

My preparation for AZ-305 was through my A Cloud Guru subscription, with the instructor yet again James Lee. I can’t recommend James enough as he is thorough, clear, and encouraging in his videos. I passed the AZ-305 exam, but did not yet earn the Azure Solutions Architect certification as I still needed to pass the AZ-104 prerequisite.

With a little confidence boost from passing the AZ-305 exam, I returned my focus on the AZ-104 which I was able to pass, and allowed me to earn two certifications at once! Passing AZ-104 by itself earns a [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/), and also combined with my AZ-305 earned the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert. Whew!

Finally, it was time to return to the AZ-400 exam. I again used my virtual tutor James Lee to learn all about continuously integrating code with Git repo, and using pipelines to continuously deploy solutions. I felt well prepared for the exam, but I was caught a little off-guard during the hands-on lab section. It involved more tasks than expected, and I did not allow myself enough time to complete them all. Time management is a key part of sitting an exam. Regardless, I was able to pass and earned the Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert certification.

## Reflection

I have jokingly said to a few people that I went a little crazy earning three Microsoft certifications this past year, but honestly, I enjoy them. Yes, they are stressful. Yes, they require time and energy and focus. However, the exam is a measurable goal with a nice recognition upon completion. The goal gives me a direction for purposful study, and the preparation guides me through learning new useful skills. Certifications are not a guarantee of anything, but like most things, you get out of it what you put into it.

## Next Steps

Now that I've (tried to) summarize my slightly crazy learning paths recently, what am I focusing on now? I debated between either starting a [Chris Gaines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gaines) cover band, or [Cryptozoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology), but ultimatley decied on three specific goals for the next few months.

One, I need to renew my [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/) certification. I will always be a data person at heart, and I still get a thrill out of building good data models, shaping data with Power Query, writing [DAX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) measures, and seeing it all come together in reports and dashboards. The new Microsoft renewal process is easy; passing an an online assessment will renew my certification for another year. I’ll get to go through the renewal process a lot next year!

Two, yet another certification! This time, I want to obtain the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/) certification. SQL Server is like an old friend, but my friend is spending a lot of time in the cloud these days. I want to stay on top of the different Azure SQL options (serverless, elastic pools, etc.) and the exam will guide me through everything I need to know.

Third, and possibly most importantly, I am focusing on hands-on practice building personal side-projects. The lab portion of the AZ-400 exam emphasized the importance of this. Instructional learning is great, but combining it with practice is key. I have already begun work on this and will be blogging about it throughout the process.

Longer-term, I have some ideas. Exploring modern data engineering, Amazon Web Services, and Linux fundamentals are all things on my radar.

What about you? What types of things are you focusing on learning? I'd love to hear from you in the comments below.
