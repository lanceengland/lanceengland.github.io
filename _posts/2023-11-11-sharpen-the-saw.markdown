# Sharpen the Saw

![Sharpening a blade](/assets/img/saw.png)

I am a big proponent of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, particularly Habit 7: [Sharpen the Saw](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-7/). At the risk of sounding slightly self-promoting, I wanted to share my focus this past year, and current goals for the next few months.

## The Certification Gauntlet

Some time ago my interest was piqued by the [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) methodology, where development and operations become more integrated to increase the delivery of value to the business. My work experience through [Improving](https://www.improving.com/) has given me an opportunity to serve in different roles on multiple projects, from architecting and developing, to deployment and tier-2 operations support. I have seen first-hand the challenges to both initial deployments and subsequent deployments for bug fixes and enhancements. DevOps sounded like a creative solution for addressing these challenges.

### AZ-400

I signed up for a DevOps boot camp and started working through the material with the goal of passing the [Exam AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-400/) exam and obtaining the [Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/devops-engineer/) certification. It didn't take long for me to realize I jumped straight into the deep end and I needed to take a few steps back and focus on some foundational knowledge first. I also discovered the certification has a prerequisite exam that I had missed.

The AZ-400 exam has a choice of two prerequisites exams: either [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-104/), or [Exam AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-204/). I felt I had more gaps on the administration path, and decided to pursue the AZ-104.

### AZ-104

I put the AZ-400 on pause, and poured into the AZ-104 material, using both the Microsoft Learning Paths and [James Lee’s AZ-104](https://learn.cloudlee.io/p/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator) course for my preparation. However, as I neared completion of the course, an opportunity/diversion presented itself.

 Microsoft was running a cloud skills challenge during their Build conference, and completion of their Azure Solutions Architect learning path earned a free voucher to sit the [Exam AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-305/) exam. The AZ-305 exam is part of two exams for the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) certification, and has the same choice of prerequisites as the DevOps Engineer Expert certification. This would give me double the "bang for my buck" for passing the AZ-104 and apply it towards two different expert certifications.

### AZ-305

So, you guessed it: I paused my preparation for AZ-104 to focus on AZ-305. Both the skills challenge and the free exam voucher itself were limited time offers, so it kept me hyper-focused on getting through the material and scheduling the exam. Man, the things I’ll do for a free voucher!

My preparation for AZ-305 was through my A Cloud Guru subscription, with the instructor yet again James Lee. I can’t recommend James enough as he is thorough, clear, and encouraging in his videos. I passed the AZ-305 exam, but did not yet earn the Azure Solutions Architect certification as I still needed to pass the AZ-104 prerequisite.

With a little confidence boost from passing the AZ-305 exam, I resumed my preparation for the AZ-104. Upon passing the exam, I earned two certifications at once! Passing AZ-104 by itself earns a [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/), and also combined with my AZ-305 earned the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert. Whew!

### Back to AZ-400

Finally, it was time to return to the AZ-400 exam. I again used my virtual tutor James Lee to learn all about continuously integrating code with Git repos, and using pipelines to continuously deploy solutions. I felt well-prepared for the exam, but I was caught a little off-guard during the hands-on lab section. It involved more tasks than expected, and I did not allow myself enough time to complete them all. Time management is a key part of sitting an exam. Regardless, I was able to pass and earned the Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert certification. Finally!

## Reflection

I have jokingly said to a few people that I went a little crazy earning three Microsoft certifications this past year, but honestly, I enjoy the process. Yes, they are stressful. Yes, they require time and energy and focus. However, the exam is a measurable goal with a nice recognition upon completion. The goal gives me a direction for purposeful study, and the preparation guides me through learning new useful skills. Certifications are not a guarantee of anything, but like most things, you get out of it what you put into it.

## Next Steps

What now? After some consideration that involved [falconry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry), [cryptozoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology), or starting a [Chris Gaines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gaines) cover band, I have zeroed in on three specific goals for the next few months.

One, renew my [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/) certification. I will always be a data person at heart, and I still get a thrill out of building good data models, shaping data with Power Query, writing [DAX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) measures, and seeing it all come together in reports and dashboards. The new Microsoft renewal process is easy; passing an online assessment will renew my certification for another year. I’ll get to go through the renewal process a lot next year!

Two, obtain the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/) certification. SQL Server is like an old friend, but my friend is spending a lot of time in the cloud these days. I want to stay on top of the different Azure SQL options (serverless, elastic pools, etc.) and the exam will guide me through everything I need to know.

Three, and possibly most importantly, focus on hands-on practice building side-projects. The lab portion of the AZ-400 exam reminded me of the importance of this. Instructional learning is great but combining it with practice is the key to deep learning. I have already started my first side-project and will be blogging about the process.

Longer-term, I have some other ideas: diving deeper into modern data engineering, branching into Amazon Web Services, and develop solid Linux fundamentals.

Sharpen the saw.
