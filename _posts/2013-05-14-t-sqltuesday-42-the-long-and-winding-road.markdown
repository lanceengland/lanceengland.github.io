# T-SQL Tuesday #42: The Long and Winding Road

[![T-SQL Tuesday](/assets/img/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg)](https://wendyverse.blogspot.com/2013/05/its-time-for-t-sqltuesday-42-long-and.html)

Life is a journey, not a destination. When I was much younger, I played drums full-time in a rock and roll band. We worked hard, and made just enough money to make the band self-supporting. It was fun while it lasted, but along the way I decided I wanted to "do something with computers".

## Drums, code, and data

I didn't know it at the time, but there is a connection between playing music and writing code. A real musician learns to play for the song, not for themselves. This means crafting individual parts that work together as a whole. This process is not unlike writing code. Each part can be re-factored until everything fits together with a simple elegance, creating something greater than the sum of its parts. I didn't realize this connection until later in life. I'll bet there are lots of skills that can be applied in seemingly different areas. I wonder where I'll apply my current skills later in life?

## Thanks

So, that's my entry for [#42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)): The Long and Winding Road. Thanks to Wendy Pastrick for hosting!
