# AZ-104 Learning Plan

I believe in lifelong learning and continuous education. The amount of change in the world of technology is constant, and moving forward is the only way to not fall behind.

As such, my current focus is study and preparation for the [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) to earn an [Azure Administrator Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator) certification. However, I still have quite a bit of work to do. I have created my own learning plan below. Some of the resources are free, and some paid. As I work through the objectives for AZ-104, I will be posting my study notes  for each.

## The Plan for AZ-104

1. Complete the [Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/) Learning Path
2. Take the (free) WhizLabs 15-question [practice test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/free-test/) for a base line score
3. Complete the (paid) [WhizLabs Azure Administrator](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/online-course/) course
4. Complete the (free) [five Microsoft Learning Paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) listed at the bottom of the exam page
5. Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #1
6. Complete the (paid) [CloudSkills.io Azure Administrator](https://cloudskills.io/courses/az-104) course
7. Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #2
8. Complete the (paid) [PluralSight Azure Administrator](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-administrator-az-104) path
9. Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #3
10. For areas that still need attention, use select videos from (free) [John Savill's Azure Master Class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGccbp8VSpAozu3w9xSQJoY) series
11. Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #4

If my brain hasn't exploded by the end of the list, I should be ready to take on the exam.
