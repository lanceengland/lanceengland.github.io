# AZ-104 Learning Plan

I'm currently preparing for the [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) to earn an [Azure Administrator Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator) certification. I have found that following a personal learning helps keep me on schedule and gives me milestones to celebrate. My personal learning plan involves a combination of free and paid resources. Similar to my [DA-100 preparation](/2020/12/da100-study-notes), I am will be posting a series of study notes, one for each objective area.

## The Plan for AZ-104

- [X] Complete the (free) [Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/) Learning Path
- [X] Take the (free) WhizLabs 15-question [practice test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/free-test/) for a base line score
- [ ] Complete the (paid) [WhizLabs Azure Administrator](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/online-course/) course
- [ ] Complete the (free) [five Microsoft Learning Paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) listed at the bottom of the exam page
- [ ] Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #1
- [ ] Complete the (paid) [CloudSkills.io Azure Administrator](https://cloudskills.io/courses/az-104) course
- [ ] Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #2
- [ ] Complete the (paid) [PluralSight Azure Administrator](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-administrator-az-104) path
- [ ] Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #3
- [ ] For areas that still need attention, use select videos from (free) [John Savill's Azure Master Class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGccbp8VSpAozu3w9xSQJoY) series
- [ ] Take the (paid) [WhizLabs Full Practice Test](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/practice-tests/) #4

If my brain hasn't exploded by the end of the list, I should be ready to take on the exam.
