# Power BI Exam 70-778 Study Guide

I recently passed the Microsoft 70-778 exam, [Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Microsoft Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-778.aspx). I thought it might be helpful to others if I shared the resources I used to prepare for the exam.

## Skills Measured

The [exam page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-778.aspx#question-types) goes into a little more detail about what is tested, but the main topic areas are

1. Consuming and Transforming Data By Using Power BI Desktop
2. Modeling and Visualizing Data
3. Configure Dashboards, Reports and Apps in the Power BI Service

I used mostly free resources, but I also have a Pluralsight account and used a few videos there. I've been working with Power BI for a few years, but mostly on side-projects. I felt very strong in DAX and Power Query, less strong in visualizations, and not strong at all in licensing, sharing, and Power BI service-related topics. My approach for preparation started off with overview videos, and then focused in on the areas that needed more attention. For example, I would search for "Power BI Gateway" in YouTube and watch enough videos until I felt comfortable, then move on to the next topic. At the same time, I would make sure I got hand-on experience. It is pretty easy to sign up for a trial Power BI Pro license, so be sure to get familiar with the Pro features.
