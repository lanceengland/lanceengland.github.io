# Fairly well, SQL PASS

SQL Pass (or PASS) has been a great amplifier of both community and professional development for thousands. I was saddened by their recent announcement:

> We are saddened to tell you that, due to the impact of COVID-19, PASS is ceasing all regular operations, effective January 15, 2021.

I have spoken at three different SQL Saturday events. I was SO nervous the first time that after my session I just had to go sit in my car in the parking lot and close my eyes. But it was a thrill. My favorite SQL Saturday was the last one I spoke at, because I was there not just representing myself, but also [Improving - Atlanta](https://improving.com/location/atlanta). Experiencing the event as a team was that much more rewarding.

Ultimately, the community is bigger than just SQL PASS. Already virtual groups are migrating to Meetup and other platforms. SQL Saturdays will likely re-emerge under a different name. That said, I still hate to see SQL PASS cease operations. Thank you to all who served as board members, volunteers, and staff.

Fairly well, SQL PASS.
