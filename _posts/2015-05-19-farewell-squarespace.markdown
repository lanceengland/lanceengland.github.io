# Farewell Squarespace

A few years ago I launched this website/blog. Squarespace was advertising on many of the podcasts I listened too so it seemed like what the cool kids were using. It was very easy to get up and running with a great looking theme that worked well on mobile.

Alas, the time has come for me to migrate to Wordpress. As much as I still like the Squarespace product, I keep trying to tweak things on my site and I'm constantly feeling friction. It's a little like 'death by 1000 paper cuts'. No complete show-stoppers, just small irritating things that need to go away.

This year I am placing a higher emphasis on my blogging, both quantity and (hopefully) quality. At the same time, I want to improve all the little parts of the website that have been nagging me for awhile.

I will be switching the domain over to my new Azure-based Wordpress site any day now. I think everything should be migrated pretty well. Let me know if you find any problems.

This is my last post on the Squarespace platform. Hello Wordpress!
