The Microsoft Learning Paths for the AZ-104 exam starts with [Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/).

## Concepts

The three main layers of cloud computing are *infrastructure as a service* (IaaS), *platform as a service* (PaaS), and a *software as a service* (SaaS). The Azure administrator role focuses mainly on the IaaS layer.

The fundamental areas for all cloud platforms are *compute*, *storage*, and *networking*. Their delineation is most defined at the infrastructure services and platform services layers, and more “blurred” at the software services layer. Let’s briefly look at each one.

**Compute** in Azure IaaS are *virtual machines*, and *containers* (with or without Kubernetes). I think there will always be a place for virtual machines, however there are many benefits to using containers including application versioning, isolation, dependency management, and deployment to name a few.

**Storage** in Azure Iaas are four core services: *Blobs*, *queues*, *files*, and *disks*. Blobs (binary large object storage) are for unstructured data. Queues are first in, first out message-based storage for decoupling asynchronous work. Files are basically file shares in the cloud. Disks are storage for use by Azure virtual machines.

**Networking** at the infrastructure layer has many components. Networks themselves are virtualized aka *virtual networks*. The Azure cloud provides *DNS* services. Hybrid cloud scenarios are enabled with *VPN Gateway*, and *Express Route*. Applications can be performant and protected with *Load Balancer*, *Traffic Manager* and *App Gateway*.

Infrastructure can be represented as code, specifically with *Azure Resource Manager* (ARM) templates. [Infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) is a powerful concept, allowing for all the benefits of source control (versioning, code review, diffs, etc.), and provide repeated consistent deployments.

### Automation

Resource management can all be done through the Azure portal, but to really scale as an administrator, you need to become familiar with PowerShell and the Azure command-line interface (CLI).

PowerShell in my opinion, is one of the most important skills to possess or acquire. Automation truly unlocks productivity, and PowerShell is one of the keys. PowerShell recently became a cross-platform tool, which increases it's reach therefore it's value. PowerShell can be used on more than just Azure. PowerShell generally follows the pattern *Verb-Noun –parameter* e.g. Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName.

The Azure CLI is another option for automating resource management. The CLI is also a cross-platform tool. Unlike PowerShell, it’s usage is solely for Azure. The CLI generally follows the pattern *az noun verb ---parameter* e.g. az resource list –resource-group.

### Mindset

Finally, the most important prerequisite is mindset. There is a lot of material covered in the exam, but it is not unobtainable knowledge. YOU CAN DO IT. There is a wealth of free and paid options to guide your efforts (for some examples, see my [learning plan](/2020/12/az104-learning-plan)). Learn at a pace that works for you, but keep moving forward. The journey is part of the benefit. Happy studying!
