# T-SQL Tuesday #104: Code I would hate to live without

This month's T-SQL Tuesday is hosted by Bert Wagner [[t](https://bertwagner.com/) \| [b](https://twitter.com/bertwagner)]. This monthâ€™s topic is 'What code would you hate to live without?'

My entry is a tiny bit of a recycle from a previous post, but, since no one reads my blog anyway I don't expect much protest. :)  In my current role, I have been writing a **lot** of SQL, particularly ETL-type code where data lands in a staging table then needs to be inserted or updated ala 'upserted' into the final destination. I've been using the T-SQL MERGE statement, which is one of the more verbose commands, especially when a lot of columns are involved. Being ~~lazy~~ efficient-minded, I decided to write a little tool to generate a full MERGE command by passing in a table name and column names. My scripting tool of choice lately is PowerShell. So, I decided to make a tool in PowerShell and post it on GitHub.

The result of my efforts is a function called Get-SqlMergeStatement. The repo is found at [https://github.com/lanceengland/SqlHelpers](https://github.com/lanceengland/SqlHelpers).

An example of how to use the function:

<pre data-enlighter-language="shell">
Get-SqlMergeStatement -TargetTableName Tbl -JoinColumns a -MergeColumns a,b,c
</pre>

Which produces the following output:

<pre data-enlighter-language="sql">
WITH SRC AS
(
    /* your source query here */
)
MERGE INTO Tbl WITH (HOLDLOCK) AS TGT
    USING SRC ON (SRC.a = TGT.a)

WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (
        a,
        b,
        c
    )
    VALUES (
        SRC.a,
        SRC.b,
        SRC.c
    )

WHEN MATCHED AND EXISTS (
    SELECT SRC.b, SRC.c
    EXCEPT
    SELECT TGT.b, TGT.c
    )
THEN
    UPDATE SET
    b = SRC.b,
    c = SRC.c

;
</pre>

The code is a plain PS1 file. At some point I might try to add a PIVOT and UNPIVOT function, as the syntax for those functions always bends my brain a bit. The entire function is a template string, with embedded snippets that iterate over the same string array and apply different transformations through the pipeline.

Anyway, I'm sure I **could** live without this code, but it would just take a lot longer to write MERGE statements. If this looks like something you can benefit from, great! Feel free to use, comment, or contribute. Thanks Bert for hosting!
