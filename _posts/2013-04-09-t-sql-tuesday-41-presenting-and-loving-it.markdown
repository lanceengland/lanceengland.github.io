Hello, T-SQL Tuesday! Thanks to **Bob Pusateri** ([blog](http://www.bobpusateri.com/)) for hosting. I'll try to make it short and sweet.

The topic today is "Presenting and Loving it". It's relevant for me because I just gave a technical presentation last week at my job. The subject of my presentation was *"MDX: Don't Panic"*.

## The Topic

MDX is a fairly new language for me - I just started learning it late 2012. So, when the opportunity presented itself a few months ago to present on MDX, I jumped on it.

Why? Because I knew it would force me to learn the language even more. And boy did it ever! As the saying goes, "If you can't explain it, you don't know it". As I worked through the material, I kept revisiting the same topics over and over. Each iteration provided clarity and reinforcement of the fundamentals.

## Practice

A few days before the presentation, I did a practice run for my friend and co-worker **Chadwick Smith** ([blog](http://www.bismiths.com/)). He offered some invaluable feedback for improving the flow of the talk. After a few days of tightening up the slides and demos, I was ready for the big day.

## Showtime

The day of the talk I was a little nervous, but I felt prepared (and that makes a HUGE difference). The reception was great, and the presentation was a success! I've been asked to give a make-up presentation to a few people that were out that day. And (I hope) that will allow me to polish it up  even more.

## Conclusions

Presenting to a group pushed me out of my comfort zone, and forced me to *really* learn a subject. I now feel like I have a solid foundation of MDX knowledge to continue building on. And I gained some confidence in my presentation skills. Who knows, maybe I'll sign up to present it at [Atlanta MDF](http://www.atlantamdf.com/) or the [Atlanta Business Intelligence](http://atlantabi.sqlpass.org/) group.
