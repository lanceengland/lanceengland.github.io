# SQL Saturday #285: Atlanta

Well, I had meant to post about this earlier, but now that we're a week away better late than never: I'm speaking at [SQL Saturday #285 - Atlanta](http://sqlsaturday.com/285/eventhome.aspx)! I'll be presenting on "[Fundamentals of MDX](http://sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=285&amp;sessionid=20871)". Anyone interested in hearing about some of the "A-ha!" moments I had while learning MDX come on out May 3rd, 2014.

As always, I'm looking forward to the event. Every year seems to get better (and more crowded). I'm not exaggerating when I say attending SQL Saturdays over the years has altered the course of my career for the better.
