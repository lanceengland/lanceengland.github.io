# 2017 Blog Update

Whew, it has been awhile since my last post ..*blows dust off the RSS feed*.. My little blog needed some attention in both routine maintenance and content.

First, I deleted all the pending spam comments. Annoying, but easy.

Second, I backed up the website and applied pending WordPress and plug-in updates.

Third, I enabled and forced HTTPS everywhere. This was inspired by the growing trend of HTTPS everywhere and particularly Troy Hunt's blog post on setting up [free SSL for an Azure website on a Shared plan](https://www.troyhunt.com/how-to-get-your-ssl-for-free-on-shared/). This was fairly easy, involving a little DNS knowledge, enabling a routing rule in my CloudFlare account, and changing one setting in the WordPress admin settings.

Finally, I just need to resume posting regularly. Should be easy, right? =P
