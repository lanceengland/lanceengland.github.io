# MDX: Fundamentals Presentation

Thank you to everyone who came out last night for my presentation on “MDX: Fundamentals” at the [Atlanta Business Intelligence User Group](http://atlantabi.sqlpass.org/) meeting. I received some good feedback, and always welcome more, be it positive or negative.

I think I could tighten the material up and smooth out some transitions better with a little more practice. And, I think I may have tried to cram too much information into the middle-to-end sections. All in all, I appreciate the opportunity and the experience.

For those interested, I have posted the [slide deck](/s/mdx_fundamentals_slides.pptx) and [demo code](/s/mdx_fundamentals_demos.zip).
