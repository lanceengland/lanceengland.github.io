Life is a journey, not a destination. When I was much younger, I played drums full-time in a rock and roll band. We worked hard, and made just enough money to make the band self-supporting. It was fun while it lasted, but along the way I decided I wanted to "do something with computers".

I didn't know it at the time, but there is a connection between playing music and writing code. A real musician learns to play for the song, not for themselves. This means crafting individual parts that work together as a whole. This process is not unlike writing code. Each part can be re-factored until everything fits together with a simple elegance, creating something greater than the sum of its parts. I didn't realize this connection until later in life. I'll bet there are lots of skills that can be applied in seemingly different areas. I wonder where I'll apply my current skills later in life?
