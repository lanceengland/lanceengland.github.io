# Wrapping up 2013 and Goals for 2014


Almost a month late, but better late than never: goal review for 2013 and new goals for 2014. 


## Goal Review 2013

### Start a website/blog


Complete. The term "personal brand" still makes me want to gag, but the underlying idea is sound. Brent Ozar has a [great post](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/12/how-start-blog/) on starting your own blog . I can still hear myself saying to a co-worker "How hard is it to blog once a week?" Ha! Harder than I thought, but we'll get to that in goals for 2014. Needless to say, my post output started strong and tapered waaay down. I managed to produce 12 posts for a meager average of 1 per month. This year is not off to a good start, as I published nothing in January. Ack!


### Present at a user group


Complete. Pushing out of my comfort zone, I presented ["Data Management and Indexing Options for SQL Server Data Warehouses"](http://lance-england.com/blog/2013/8/13/data-management-and-indexing-options-for-sql-server-data-warehouses) to the [Atlanta MDF](http://www.atlantamdf.com/events.aspx) user group. The presentation was well received and it has given me the motivation to present again (more on that in a minute).


### SQL server 2012 certification


FAIL. OK, first missed goal. I don't know why, but when studying for the tests I always start strong, but then I let life get in the way and find it hard to pick it back up. And if I'm being really honest, I probably have a tiny part in my brain that is afraid to fail the test AND BE EXPOSED TO THE WHOLE WORLD FOR THE FRAUD THAT I AM. Ahem. Well, identifying the problem is the first step.


### Move into the consulting business


Complete! My biggest career jump so far, I had been preparing myself for a year to give it a try and finally had an opportunity present itself. I launched Data Join Consulting, LLC in Q4 2013.


### Deep-dive learn MDX


Complete, and on-going. This was a murky goal, in that it doesn't fit the [SMART criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). I started the year with only a cursory knowledge of MDX, but I wanted to really dive in a learn as much as possible. MDX has a learning curve, but when the light turned on I really became of a fan of the language. There are some things I would love to change about it, but it is extremely powerful. Learning MDX is a journey not a destination, but I am much farther along today than I was this time last year. 


### Random
#### TRAINING

  *  I attended a 5-day "Advanced T-SQL" with Itzik Ben-Gan that was fantastic and too short.

  *  I attended a 2-day "Master SSIS" class with Brian Knight.
#### BOOKS READ

  *  [Practical MDX Queries](http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?cat=112&amp;isbn=0071713360)

  *  [Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services Multidimensional Performance and Operations Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11608.e-book-gallery-for-microsoft-technologies.aspx#MicrosoftSQLServerAnalysisServicesMultidimensionalPerformanceandOperationsGuide)
#### BOOKS INCOMPLETE

As I was looking through my iPad to remember what books I read last year, I'm realizing that I start too many books simultaneously and have left too many unfinished. The following I have partially read, and intend to finish:

  *  [Inside the Query Optimizer](http://www.red-gate.com/community/books/inside-sql-server-query-optimizer)

  *  [Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Training Kit](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145345059.do)

  *  [MDX Solutions](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471748080.html)

  *  [MDX with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Analysis Services: Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/mdx-with-microsoft-sql-server-2008-r2-analysis-services/book)

  *  [Expert Cube Development with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Analysis Server](http://www.packtpub.com/expert-cube-development-with-microsoft-sql-server-2008-analysis-services/book)

  *  [Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Analysis Services Unleashed](http://www.informit.com/store/microsoft-sql-server-2008-analysis-services-unleashed-9780672330018)

  *  [Star Schema, The Complete Reference](http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071744339)
## NEW GOALS FOR 2014

### SQL server 2012 certification


At the least, I need to pass [461](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-461.aspx), [462](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-462.aspx), and [463](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-463.aspx). Time to take care of business.


### Finish the books left unread from last year


No need to list them again.


### C&#35;


While I stay focued on SQL Server and BI-related technologies, I want to at least keep my skills current on modern C# development. Jon Skeet has some C# courses at PluralSight that I want to watch, particularly [Mastering C# 4.0](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/skeet-csharp4) and [C# Design Strategies](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/csharp-design-strategies).


### Social/Reach

  *  I will best my blog post output from last year. One down, (at least) 12 to go! 

  *  I will present at one user group this year. As a matter of fact, I'm already scheduled to present <span style="font-weight:bold;">"MDX: Fundamentals"</span> at the February 2014 meeting of the [Atlanta Microsoft Business Intelligence](http://atlantabi.sqlpass.org/) user group. 

Time to get moving!
 
Reviewing 2013 and setting goals for 2014.
